# ISO 9001 Section Selection Feature - Implementation Guide

## üéØ Overview

The ISO 9001 Audit Tool now includes comprehensive section selection functionality that allows auditors to customize their audit scope by selecting specific ISO 9001:2015 sections. This transforms the tool from a comprehensive audit checklist into a flexible, customizable audit platform.

## üöÄ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Section Selection Interface** (`/scope`)
- **Interactive Section Cards**: Each ISO 9001 section (4-10) displayed with:
  - Section title and description
  - Question count and risk level indicators
  - Industry-specific relevance for water/wastewater utilities
  - Visual risk indicators (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

- **Quick Templates**: Pre-configured audit templates including:
  - **Full ISO 9001 Audit**: All sections (4-10)
  - **Leadership & Planning Focus**: Sections 4, 5, 6
  - **Operations & Performance Focus**: Sections 8, 9, 10
  - **Support Systems Audit**: Section 7
  - **Regulatory Compliance Focus**: Sections 4, 6, 8, 9
  - **Water Quality Management**: Sections 5, 8, 9

- **Custom Selection**: Manual section selection with real-time scope summary

### 2. **Enhanced Data Management**
- **Updated Store Architecture**: Extended Zustand store with:
  - `auditScope` state management
  - Section-based filtering methods
  - Section progress tracking
  - Persistent scope selection

- **New Data Structures**:
  ```typescript
  interface AuditScope {
    selectedSections: Set<string>;
    template?: string;
    customScope: boolean;
  }
  
  interface SectionProgress {
    sectionId: string;
    totalQuestions: number;
    assessedQuestions: number;
    omittedQuestions: number;
    completionPercentage: number;
    sectionScore: number;
  }
  ```

### 3. **Intelligent Question Filtering**
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Questions automatically filtered based on selected sections
- **Hierarchical Support**: Maintains parent-child question relationships
- **Real-time Updates**: Scope changes immediately reflected across all pages

### 4. **Enhanced Navigation & Progress Tracking**
- **Section-Based Navigation**: Jump between sections in audit execution
- **Visual Progress Indicators**: Section-specific progress bars and completion percentages
- **Scope Indicators**: Clear display of current audit scope throughout the application

### 5. **Updated User Interface**
- **Dashboard Enhancements**: Section progress cards with individual completion tracking
- **Audit Execution**: Section navigation bar with clickable section progress
- **Questions Management**: Scope-aware question filtering and display
- **Navigation Bar**: New "Scope" tab for easy access to section selection

## üìä Technical Implementation

### Core Files Modified/Created:

1. **`/lib/types.ts`** - Extended with section and scope interfaces
2. **`/lib/section-data.ts`** - New file with section definitions and templates
3. **`/hooks/use-audit-store.ts`** - Enhanced with section filtering and progress methods
4. **`/app/scope/page.tsx`** - New section selection interface
5. **`/app/page.tsx`** - Dashboard with section progress display
6. **`/app/audit/page.tsx`** - Enhanced with section navigation
7. **`/app/questions/page.tsx`** - Updated with scope-aware filtering
8. **`/components/navigation.tsx`** - Added Scope tab

### Key Methods Added:

```typescript
// Store methods
getFilteredQuestions(): AuditQuestion[]
getSectionProgress(sectionId: string): SectionProgress
updateAuditScope(scope: Partial<AuditScope>): void

// Section utilities
getSectionById(sectionId: string): ISO9001Section
getTemplateById(templateId: string): AuditTemplate
getSectionQuestionCount(sectionNumber: string): number
```

## üé® User Experience Features

### Visual Indicators:
- **Risk Level Badges**: Color-coded risk indicators for each section
- **Progress Bars**: Real-time completion tracking per section
- **Scope Summary**: Live statistics showing selected sections and question counts
- **Template Highlights**: Visual selection feedback for templates

### Responsive Design:
- **Mobile-First**: Fully responsive across all devices
- **Grid Layouts**: Adaptive section cards and progress displays
- **Touch-Friendly**: Large clickable areas for mobile users

### Accessibility:
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for section selection
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Color Contrast**: High contrast indicators for visual accessibility

## üîß Usage Workflow

### 1. **Select Audit Scope**
1. Navigate to "Scope" tab
2. Choose from quick templates or create custom selection
3. Review scope summary with question counts
4. Save scope and proceed to audit

### 2. **Execute Audit**
1. Questions automatically filtered to selected sections
2. Use section navigation to jump between areas
3. Track progress per section in real-time
4. Complete assessment with focused scope

### 3. **Monitor Progress**
1. Dashboard shows section-specific progress
2. Overall completion based on selected scope only
3. Section scores calculated independently
4. Export includes scope documentation
